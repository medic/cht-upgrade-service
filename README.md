CHT Upgrade Service
========================

The CHT Upgrade Service provides an interface between CHT-Core API and Docker to allow easy startup and one-click upgrades from the CHT-Core Admin UI. 

## Requirements

* Docker
* docker-compose

### Directories 

To use the CHT Upgrade service, you need to have three directories:
1. CHT Core & CouchDB compose files
2. CouchDB database 
3. Upgrade Service 

## Example Usage

Assuming you wanted to create a new project called `cht-4-first-run` in your user `me`'s home directory, and you want to use the least amount of env vars,  you would follow these steps below. It will create a self signed cert, use port `80` and port `443`. If you're doing a lot of testing, you might want to ensure no other docker containers are running with `docker kill $(docker ps  -q)`. Then follow these steps:

1. Create a directory to house your CHT Core and CouchDB compose files. You need a unique pair of these per project you run.  We'll use `cht-4-first-run`: 
    ```
    mkdir -p ~/cht-4-first-run/compose
    cd ~/cht-4-first-run
    ```
1. Download CHT Core, CouchDB and Upgrade Service compose files into the new directory you just created: 
    ```
    cd ~/cht-4-first-run
    curl -s -o ./compose/cht-couchdb.yml https://staging.dev.medicmobile.org/_couch/builds_4/medic:medic:master/docker-compose/cht-couchdb.yml
    curl -s -o ./compose/cht-core.yml https://staging.dev.medicmobile.org/_couch/builds_4/medic:medic:master/docker-compose/cht-core.yml
    curl -s -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/medic/cht-upgrade-service/main/docker-compose.yml
    ```
1. Create a file in `~/cht-4-first-run` to house your variables.  Call it `.env` and give it the following contents (Note these are insecure password - use **secure** password for production!). Note if you're trying to run this locally that you replace `/home/me` with your actual home dir path:
   ```
   CHT_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=4-first-run
   COUCHDB_SECRET=password
   DOCKER_CONFIG_PATH=/home/me/cht-4-first-run/compose
   COUCHDB_DATA=/home/me/cht-4-first-run/couchd
   CHT_COMPOSE_PATH=/home/me/cht-4-first-run/compose
   COUCHDB_USER=medic
   COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password
   ```
1. Call `up` with docker:
   ```
   cd ~/cht-4-first-run
   docker compose up
   ```
 1. Your instance should now be available at [localhost](https://localhost) with login `medic` and password `password`.  You will need to accept the self signed certificate the first time you access the instance.

## API

The API is only available on the `cht-net` docker network, and listens to port `5008`. 

### GET / 

Expected response:
```HTTP/1.1 200```
```json
{ "ok": true }
```


### POST /upgrade

Accepts a payload that contains pairs of docker-compose file names and contents. It

- overwrites the files with the corresponding name in the `CHT_COMPOSE_PATH` folder
- validates the contents of each file before overwriting
- does not create new files, if a matching file does not already exist in `CHT_COMPOSE_PATH` folder, writing is skipped
- pulls docker images from every updated file (`docker-compose pull -f <file>`)
- when all files have been processed, executes a `docker-compose up` over all files in the folder, restarting the containers that have new images.

Request body:
```Accepts: application/json```
```json
{
  "docker_compose": {
    "<file_name1>": "<file contents>",
    "<file_name2>": "<file contents>"
  }
}
```

Expected successful response:
```HTTP/1.1 200```
```json
{
  "<file_name1>": { "ok": true },
  "<file_name2>": { "ok": true }
}
```

Expected successful response when a file is skipped:
```HTTP/1.1 200```
```json
{
  "<existent_file>": { "ok": true },
  "<non_existent_file>": { "ok": false, "reason": "Existing installation not found. Use '/install' API to install." }
}
```

Expected error response:
```HTTP/1.1 500```
```json
{
  "error": true,
  "reason": "<error details>"
}
```

### POST /install

Accepts a payload that contains pairs of docker-compose file names and contents. It

- creates the files with the corresponding name in the `CHT_COMPOSE_PATH` folder
- validates the contents of each file before creation
- does not overwrite existing files, if a matching file already exists in `CHT_COMPOSE_PATH` folder, writing is skipped
- pulls docker images from every updated file (`docker-compose pull -f <file>`)
- when all files have been processed, does a `docker-compose up` over all files in the folder, which start the new containers.

Request body:
```Accepts: application/json```
```json
{
  "docker_compose": {
    "<file_name1>": "<file contents>",
    "<file_name2>": "<file contents>"
  }
}
```

Expected successful response:
```HTTP/1.1 200```
```json
{
  "<file_name1>": { "ok": true },
  "<file_name2>": { "ok": true }
}
```

Expected successful response when a file is skipped:
```HTTP/1.1 200```
```json
{
  "<existent_file>": { "ok": false, "reason": "Existing installation found. Use '/upgrade' API to upgrade." },
  "<non_existent_file>": { "ok": true }
}
```

Expected error response:
```HTTP/1.1 500```
```json
{
  "error": true,
  "reason": "<error details>"
}
```

### POST /start

Starts all containers from all valid docker compose files in the `CHT_COMPOSE_PATH` folder.

Expected response:
```HTTP/1.1 200```
```json
{ "ok": true }
```
